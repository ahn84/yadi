# YADI - Yet Another Dependency Injection Library

## Project Overview

YADI is a modern, type-safe dependency injection library for Go that leverages generics and reflection to provide a clean and efficient DI container implementation.

## Current State

The library currently has:
- ✅ Core container structure with reflection-based binding
- ✅ Basic binding and resolution mechanisms
- ✅ Singleton support
- ✅ Named bindings (partial)
- ✅ Thread-safe operations (partial)
- ✅ Basic error handling

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core API Enhancement (Essential)

#### 1.1 Public API Methods
**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] **`Bind[T](resolver func(...) T) error`** - Generic binding method
- [ ] **`BindSingleton[T](resolver func(...) T) error`** - Singleton binding
- [ ] **`BindNamed[T](name string, resolver func(...) T) error`** - Named binding
- [ ] **`BindValue[T](value T) error`** - Direct value binding
- [ ] **`Resolve[T]() (T, error)`** - Generic resolution
- [ ] **`ResolveNamed[T](name string) (T, error)`** - Named resolution

#### 1.2 Thread Safety
**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] Complete thread-safe operations for all public methods
- [ ] Proper read/write locking in binding operations
- [ ] Concurrent resolution safety
- [ ] Race condition testing

#### 1.3 Error Handling
**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] Custom error types (`ErrNotFound`, `ErrCircularDependency`, `ErrInvalidBinding`)
- [ ] Circular dependency detection algorithm
- [ ] Detailed error messages with dependency chain
- [ ] Error aggregation for multiple failures

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

#### 2.1 Lifecycle Management
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] **Scoped instances** (Request, Session, Custom scopes)
- [ ] **Cleanup/Disposal** interface for resource management
- [ ] **Post-construction** callbacks (`PostConstruct` interface)
- [ ] **Pre-destruction** callbacks (`PreDestroy` interface)
- [ ] Automatic cleanup on container disposal

#### 2.2 Advanced Binding
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] **Interface to concrete** type binding with automatic detection
- [ ] **Factory binding** with parameters
- [ ] **Conditional binding** based on context/environment
- [ ] **Optional dependencies** support
- [ ] **Collection binding** (slice injection)

#### 2.3 Dependency Graph
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] Dependency graph construction and validation
- [ ] Circular dependency detection at registration time
- [ ] Graph visualization utilities
- [ ] Startup-time validation
- [ ] Dependency tree debugging tools

### Phase 3: Developer Experience

#### 3.1 Code Generation
**Priority: LOW**

- [ ] **Wire-like** automatic dependency injection
- [ ] **Build-time** dependency validation
- [ ] Code generation for performance optimization

#### 3.2 Middleware & Interceptors
**Priority: LOW**

- [ ] Method interception framework
- [ ] Logging and metrics collection
- [ ] Performance monitoring hooks
- [ ] Custom interceptor registration

#### 3.3 Configuration
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] **YAML/JSON** configuration support
- [ ] **Environment-based** configuration
- [ ] Configuration validation
- [ ] Hot-reload capabilities

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation

#### 4.1 Testing Support
**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] Mock container for testing
- [ ] Dependency overrides for tests
- [ ] Test utilities and helpers
- [ ] Integration test framework
- [ ] Benchmark suite

#### 4.2 Documentation
**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] Comprehensive README with examples
- [ ] API documentation (godoc)
- [ ] Usage examples for common patterns
- [ ] Best practices guide
- [ ] Migration guide from other DI libraries
- [ ] Performance characteristics documentation

#### 4.3 Benchmarking
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] Performance tests vs manual instantiation
- [ ] Memory usage analysis
- [ ] Comparison with other Go DI libraries
- [ ] Scalability testing
- [ ] Profiling integration

### Phase 5: Integration & Ecosystem

#### 5.1 Framework Integration
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] **Gin** middleware and integration
- [ ] **Echo** framework support
- [ ] **gRPC** service injection
- [ ] **HTTP handlers** injection
- [ ] **Database connection** management

#### 5.2 Common Patterns
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] Repository pattern helpers
