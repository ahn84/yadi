# YADI - Yet Another Dependency Injection Library

## Project Overview

YADI is a modern, type-safe dependency injection library for Go that leverages generics and reflection to provide a clean and efficient DI container implementation.

## Current State

The library currently has:
- âœ… Core container structure with reflection-based binding
- âœ… Complete binding and resolution mechanisms
- âœ… Full option pattern implementation (WithSingleton, WithName, WithEager/Lazy, etc.)
- âœ… Singleton support with lazy/eager initialization options
- âœ… Named bindings (complete)
- âœ… Thread-safe operations (complete)
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling
- âœ… Convenience methods (BindSingleton, BindNamed, BindNamedSingleton)
- âœ… Extensive test suite with 97.8% coverage
- âœ… Working examples and documentation
- âœ… Clean interface{} API (rejected generic approach for better usability)

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core API Enhancement (COMPLETED âœ…)

#### 1.1 Public API Methods
**Priority: HIGH** - âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] **`Bind(resolver interface{}, options ...BindOption) error`** - Clean interface{} API with option pattern
- [x] **`BindSingleton(resolver interface{}, options ...BindOption) error`** - Singleton convenience method
- [x] **`BindNamed(name string, resolver interface{}, options ...BindOption) error`** - Named binding convenience method  
- [x] **`BindNamedSingleton(name string, resolver interface{}, options ...BindOption) error`** - Named singleton convenience method
- [x] **`Resolve(target interface{}) error`** - Clean resolution using pointers
- [x] **`ResolveNamed(target interface{}, name string) error`** - Named resolution

**Design Decision:** Chose interface{} API over generics for cleaner, more idiomatic Go code.

#### 1.2 Option Pattern Implementation  
**Priority: HIGH** - âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] **`WithSingleton()`** - Singleton lifecycle option
- [x] **`WithTransient()`** - Transient lifecycle option (default)

- [x] **`WithEager()`** - Eager initialization option  
- [x] **`WithLazy()`** - Lazy initialization option (default)
- [x] **Functional options pattern** for flexible configuration

#### 1.3 Thread Safety
